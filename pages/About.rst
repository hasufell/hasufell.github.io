Hi, I'm Julian, a tech enthusiast and open source collaborator.

Check out my `Github Profile <https://github.com/hasufell>`_
or my `CV <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasufell/hasufell/master/cv.pdf>`_. Some of my stuff is only available through my `private gitea server <https://gogs.hasufell.de/>`_.

I like coding in Haskell, Rust, sometimes python and bash.

Some of my projects and code:
